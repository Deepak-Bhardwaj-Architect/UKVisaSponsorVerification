United Kingdom Sponsor Data Analysis with Java Streams and Parallel Streams and comparisons

Things which are covered:

Reading CSV data using CSVReader
check count
preparing List of objects to process
evaluating range check
checking whether a given company is registered or not
processing above point by streams and parallel streams
comparing times b/w Streams and parallel streams
inconsistency in parallel streams
Inconsistency in parallel streams: Here while searching element in records which returned from parallelstream objects don’t give guarantee because records are splits to be processed in parallel and while comparing one chunk of data is beings considered to compare, that’s why there is inconsistency in parallel streams and how Spark will handle this with minimum code with consistency we will see in upcoming post

Later we will compare the same analysis with Spark and see differences in execution and with respect to time comoplexity
